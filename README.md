specific colluns of the database using the ID, how to insert  and modify the data.
I used this knowlegde to create the functions to deposit and withdraw values.
I also learned how to modify the data , both when it  was increased and when it
was decreased.Additionally,I learned how to use a foreign key togheterwith  JPA.
